# create a basic linux fs
#  options include rob's mkroot or something like buildroot
#  we can also simply just pacstrap a basic archlinux install
sudo pacstrap -c basic_linux/ base linux linux-firmware

# configure it
#   arch-chroot needs a proper mount (otherwise things like pacman won't work)
#   so we bind mount 
mkdir basic_linux_bm
mount --bind basic_linux basic_linux_bm
arch-chroot basic_linux_bm
  # install your tools
  # set password
  # put "dmesg -n 1" somewhere, will suppress console dmesg output

# wrap it up 
 # cpio if you want initramfs
 # I had trouble getting this to work, something about no root device, even with root=/dev/ram :(
 # find basic_linux/ -print0 | cpio --block-size=8192 --null -ov --format=newc | gzip - > initramfs.img

 # otherwise ext4 seems to work
 # p.s. prepopulating an ext4 fs from a dir is a wonderful feature
  mkfs.ext4 -d basic_linux rootfs2.ext4

# get your kernel and you're ready to go
cp $some-kernel-somewhere bzImage
